**Research for Impact: Addressing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss and Noise Nuisance**

At Beatbix, our commitment to innovation extends beyond the realms of technology to the very heart of societal challenges. In a strategic alliance with research institutes, companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), we have dedicated a significant part of our company to research activities aimed at tackling pressing issues that affect global well-being.

Currently, we are passionately engaged in addressing the pervasive problem of Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an alarming 1.1 billion young people are at risk of permanent hearing loss due to exposure to loud music. This staggering statistic underscores the urgency and importance of our efforts to pioneer solutions that protect and preserve auditory health.

Beyond the individual health impact, we also recognize the broader societal consequences. Music in recreational settings, especially in urban areas, not only poses a risk to individuals but also contributes to noise nuisance for residents. The WHO estimates that at least 1 million healthy life years are lost annually in EU member states alone due to noise nuisance associated with recreational activities.

Our research endeavors aim to bridge the gap between innovation and public health, leveraging technology to mitigate the risks posed by excessive noise exposure. By collaborating with diverse partners, including research institutes, companies, and NGOs, we seek to develop solutions that not only safeguard auditory health but also contribute to creating quieter, more harmonious urban environments.

Join us on this journey as we strive to turn the volume down on societal challenges, working towards a world where the joy of music and recreational activities coexists harmoniously with the well-being of individuals and communities.
